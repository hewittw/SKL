main.py is the file that contains my actual program

winequalityReds.csv is the file that contains all the data I used 

A little about my program:
Use different scikit learn algorthims to estimate the quality of wines. The quality assigned to the wines in the data set was determined by 3 wine judges.
The machine learning algorithm is using objective facts about the wine listed in the data set, then looking at their corresponding score, to determine 
trends to figure out the wine quality.
